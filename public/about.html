<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Daniel Andujar, I'm currently 24 years old and a Computer Science student.</p>

<p>Since I was young, I have been interested in computers and anything about technology, 
  I fell in love with my first desktop computer and quickly got used to it (not everything of course!). 
  Still, I realized my fascination with computers and what I could do. Now I spend most of my time learning
  about new technologies, programming languages, and more.</p>

<p>feel welcome to contact me in case you have any questions or any other reason through the link "Contact Me"
   where my email is, and I hope you liked the page despite the fact that it is only made in HTML and not he has
   a great style, lol.</p>
